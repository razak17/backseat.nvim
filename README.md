# Commands
| User Command | Purpose |
| -- | -- |
| `:Backseat`  | Sends the current buffer to OpenAI to highlight readability feedback |
| `:BackseatAsk <question>` | Ask a question about the code in the current buffer (i.e What does the function on line 20 do?, Summarize this code)
| `:BackseatClear` | Clear all Backseat highlighting from the current buffer
| `:BackseatClearLine` | Clear the current line of Backseat highlighting

If a buffer contains more than 100 lines, it will be split into multiple <= 100 line requests.
## Requirements
 * curl
 * OpenAI API key - You can get yours with a free account from [their website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). If you don't have any more free credits, usage is very cheap at ~$0.004 per 100 lines submitted.
# Install
### Lazy plugin manager
```lua
{
    "james1236/backseat.nvim",
    dependencies = { 'MunifTanjim/nui.nvim' },
    config = function()
        require("backseat").setup({
            -- Alternatively, set the env var $OPENAI_API_KEY by putting "export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxx" in your ~/.bashrc
            openai_api_key = 'sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx', -- Get yours from platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
            openai_model_id = 'gpt-3.5-turbo', --gpt-4 (If you do not have access to a model, it says "The model does not exist")
            -- Default popup type
            popup_type = "popup" | "horizontal" | "vertical",
            winhighlight = "Normal:Normal,FloatBorder:FloatBorder",
            -- language = 'english', -- Such as 'japanese', 'french', 'pirate', 'LOLCAT'
            -- split_threshold = 100,
            -- additional_instruction = "Respond snarkily", -- (GPT-3 will probably deny this request, but GPT-4 complies)
            -- highlight = {
            --     icon = '', -- ''
            --     group = 'Comment',
            -- }
        })
    end
},
```
### The result of using `additional_instruction = "Respond snarkily"`

# Config 
| Setup Table Name | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | -- |
| `openai_api_key` | `nil` | Your OpenAI API key, needed to use their language models
| `openai_model_id` | `'gpt-3.5-turbo'` | The model's identifier, such as gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4
| `language` | `'english'` | The language of suggestions, such as 'japanese', 'french' or made up ones like 'pirate', 'LOLCAT'
| `split_threshold` | `100` | The max number of lines of code sent per request (lower uses more tokens but increases number of suggestions)
| `additional_instruction`, | `nil` | An additional instruction to give the AI, like "Make your responses more brief"
